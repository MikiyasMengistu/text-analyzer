### How this system works?
- User should enter text of any length or hit enter with no text to exit.
- The user should insert 3 separate letters (or substrings) - if he enters a the same letter or substring twice
    keep asking for the letter again.
#### Printout:
- How many times does every selected letter appear (regardless of case)
- How many words are there in total in the text.
- First and last letters of each word ,its number in the list (not index but its "people" number) and its
    length.
- Invert the order of the words of the list and print the list inverted (only the word order in the list not the)
    Internal word order, example list = [‘people’,’like’,’running’] -reversed→ [‘running’,’like’,‘people’]
- Look for the word python in the list and printout,  if python is in the text or “the word python not in text” if its not in the text.
