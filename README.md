### How this system works?
- User should enter text of any length or hit enter with no text to exit.
- The user should insert 3 separate letters (or substrings) - if he enters a the same letter or substring twice
    keep asking for the letter again.
#### Printout:
- How many times does every selected letter appear (regardless of case)
- How many words are there in total in the text.
- First and last letters of each word ,its number in the list (not index but its "people" number) and its
    length.
- Invert the order of the words of the list and print the list inverted (only the word order in the list not the)
    Internal word order, example list = [‘people’,’like’,’running’] -reversed→ [‘running’,’like’,‘people’]
- Look for the word python in the list and printout,  if python is in the text or “the word python not in text” if its not in the text.

In this project i teried to write a code that enables us to play lottary game. Suppose the user plays a game and wins, then the system asks him to enter the ID number and the bank account of the user. Once those data are entered, the system immediately records the data on the server in tabular form. This registration will help to pay the prize to the winner. 
###  How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
- The Powerball game includes two parts.
- Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly
    from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20).
- Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly
    from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10).
- When the program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers,
    your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
- If the user winns the game, the system asks him/her to enter phone number and id and user's profile and gmae history will be 
    registerd on SQL server.
